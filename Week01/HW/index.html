            Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe that is slightly elevated with 
            the addition of browned butter. They always come out beautiful and delicious and 
            are perfect for any occasion!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 cups [284 g] all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons [1 1/2 sticks or 170 g] unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup [150 g] granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup [150 g] brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg plus 1 large yolk</li>
            <li>8 oz [226 g] bittersweet chocolate, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>Fleur de sel, for finishing (optional)</li>
         </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line three sheet pans with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
            <li> Slice 4 tablespoons [57 g] of the butter into four pieces, and place them 
                in a large bowl. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons [113 g] of butter in a 
                medium skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the butter until it is dark golden 
                brown and is giving off a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the browned butter 
                into the bowl with the room-temperature butter, and stir until all the butter 
                is melted and combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the granulated and brown sugars, vanilla, and salt with a rubber 
                spatula, mixing until combined. Whisk in the egg and the yolk until fully 
                combined, about 45 seconds, until it is smooth and glossy. Let the batter sit 
                for 2 to 3 minutes, and then whisk again for 45 seconds. Pour the flour mixture 
                into the bowl and use the spatula to combine. Place the chopped chocolate over 
                the dough and use your hands to knead it in until it is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into 1 1/2 oz [45 g] balls (2 tablespoons). Place 8 cookies on 
                each sheet pan. </li>
            <li>Bake one pan at a time, rotating halfway through baking. For soft cookies with 
                a gooey center, bake the cookies until the sides are set, the centers are very 
                puffed, and the dough is still light, 8 to 9 minutes. For cookies with a crispy 
                edge and tender center, bake until the cookies are light golden brown around the 
                edges and the centers are still slightly puffed, 9 to 10 minutes. For cookies 
                with a crisp edge and firm center, bake until the cookies are golden brown around 
                the edges and the centers have begun to collapse, 10 to 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the cookies cool for 10 minutes, then 
                move the cookies to the wire rack to cool. Sprinkle the cookies with fleur de 
                sel, if desired, a few minutes after they emerge from the oven. Store cookies in 
                an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, but they're best eaten 
                warm.</li>
