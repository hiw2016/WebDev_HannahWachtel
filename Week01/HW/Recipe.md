# Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe that is slightly elevated with the addition of browned butter. They always come out beautiful and delicious and are perfect for any occasion!

*Makes about 20 cookies*

## Ingredients

- 2 cups [284 g] all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 12 tablespoons [1 1/2 sticks or 170 g] unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3/4 cup [150 g] granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup [150 g] brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg plus 1 large yolk
- 8 oz [226 g] bittersweet chocolate, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- Fleur de sel, for finishing (optional)

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line three sheet pans with parchment paper.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
3. Slice 4 tablespoons [57 g] of the butter into four pieces, and place them in a large bowl. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons [113 g] of butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the butter until it is dark golden brown and is giving off a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the browned butter into the bowl with the room-temperature butter, and stir until all the butter is melted and combined. 
4. Stir in the granulated and brown sugars, vanilla, and salt with a rubber spatula, mixing until combined. Whisk in the egg and the yolk until fully combined, about 45 seconds, until it is smooth and glossy. Let the batter sit for 2 to 3 minutes, and then whisk again for 45 seconds. Pour the flour mixture into the bowl and use the spatula to combine. Place the chopped chocolate over the dough and use your hands to knead it in until it is evenly distributed.
5. Form the dough into 1 1/2 oz [45 g] bals (2 tablespoons). Place 8 cookies on each sheet pan. 
6. Bake one pan at a time, rotating halfway through baking. For soft cookies with a gooey center, bake the cookies until the sides are set, the centers are very puffed, ond the dough is still light, 8 to 9 minutes. For cookies with a crispy edge and tender center, bake until the cookies are light golden brown around the edges and the centers are still slightly puffed, 9 to 10 minutes. For cookies with a crisp edge and firm center, bake until the cookies are golden brown around the edges and the centers have begun to collapse, 10 to 11 minutes.
7. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the cookies cool for 10 minutes, then move the cookies to the wire rack to cool. Sprinkle the cookies with fleur de sel, if desired, a few minutes after they emerge from the oven. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, but they're best eaten warm.
